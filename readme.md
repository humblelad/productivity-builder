This simple repo is the one stop easy destination to track your productivity levels throughtout the years. 
A simple thumb rule for this is that you must be honest while you do this!!

HOW TO DO ?

1. CREATE A @username.txt file and issue a pull request. 
2. Now we will follow a bit of old scholl type Robinson Crusoe type of methodology :P 

Starting of Month mention the date. 

  
  A) IF YOU DID SOMETHING MEANINNGFUL TYPE 1 AND COMMIT; next day 2.
  B) IF NOT TYPE -1 AND COMMIT . 
  C) AT THE END OF EACH MONTH ADD IT UP. 
  D) TRY TO MAKE SURE THE PERCENTAGE IS ATLEAST ABOVE 80%
  
  A demonstration file is available in the repo!
  
  NOTE- I KNOW IT MAY FEEL A BIT AWKWARD TO DO THIS AND AGAIN BUT TRUST ME IT HELPS FOR MOTIVATION. DO IT VIA COMMANDLINE AFTER CLONING TO LOCAL MACHINE AND THEN PUSHING THE TEXT FILE BACK.
